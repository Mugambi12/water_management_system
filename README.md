### Overview

This repository houses a Flask-based web application designed to streamline and optimize water management processes. The application empowers users with various functionalities, including:

- **Secure user management:** Facilitates secure user registration, login, and logout.
- **Role-based access control:** Enhances security by assigning different access levels (e.g., standard user, administrator).
- **Dynamic dashboards:** Provides users with personalized insights into their water usage patterns through interactive charts and graphs.
- **Water consumption and expense tracking:** Enables users to monitor their water consumption and associated expenses, promoting accountability and responsible water use.
- **Real-time chat:** Fosters communication and collaboration among users.
- **Admin broadcast messages:** Allows administrators to keep users informed through announcements and updates.
- **Feedback tracking system:** Gathers valuable user input to facilitate continuous improvement of the application.

This technology-driven approach aims to address water sustainability challenges by empowering users and encouraging responsible water management practices.
